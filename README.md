#BRVE

###Heroku: [BRVE](http://hungrypenguin.bitballoon.com)

###I. Description: 

BRVE (Brave) provides users an opportunity to challenge themselves in ways they never thought possible. Users can embark on a new journey by creating a challenge they hope to overcome. Scared of approaching challenges alone? Join a challenge and be a part of a community and gain the support you need to complete the challenge. If they can do it, you can too! 

###II. Technologies Used:

* Ruby on Rails
* Bootstrap
* Google Fonts
* CSS
* HTML

####III. Unsolved Problems:

* It would be nice to have a countdown for the goal date or a reminder that the goal date is approaching. 
* Challenge thumbnail images have a fixed size and stretches in weird ways.
* On the user homepage, the challenge thumbnails do not stay on the right side of the page once the list gets longer than the left side.
* The homepage is not user-friendly. Help make the sign up and login options more visible.
